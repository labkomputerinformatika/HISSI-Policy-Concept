## Overview

The **Humanoid Industrial Security & Standards Initiative (HISSI)** is an independent policy concept to secure the supply chain for humanoid robotics in U.S. defense and allied operations. As humanoid systems transition from experimental platforms to mission-critical assets for logistics, maintenance, and support roles, reliance on global suppliers—particularly in adversarial nations—poses risks of sabotage, backdoors, or supply denial. With China controlling over 50% of global robotics production and critical materials, HISSI proposes a four-pillar framework to ensure trusted, ethical manufacturing, aligning with **DoDI 5200.44**, **NIST SP 800-161**, and **CHIPS Act** models. This initiative upholds a “do no harm” ethos, preventing vulnerabilities that could endanger U.S. and allied forces while fostering a **$50 billion domestic robotics sector by 2030**.

- **40,000** high-skill jobs  
- **$500 million** pilot  
- **CHIPS-style** incentives  
- **DoDI 5200.44**, **NIST SP 800-161**

## Purpose

This repository shares the HISSI concept for public discussion and feedback. It aims to spark dialogue among policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders on securing humanoid robotics for national security and ethical innovation. The framework proposes:
- Trusted manufacturing in the U.S. or allied nations  
- Modular open systems (**MOSA-H**) for inspectable, secure designs  
- Rigorous testing via a **Humanoid Test & Evaluation Center (HTEC)**  
- Economic growth through **40,000 high-skill jobs** and **CHIPS-style incentives**
